> "Data is no longer a record of the past. It is the engine that drives the real world."

This is an open-source book project that decodes the core concept of "Ontology" — the heart of Palantir, the world's most powerful data platform — not merely as an IT technology, but as
"the operational foundation that shapes organizational decision-making and the future of AI."

To bridge the deep gap between the cutting edge of engineering and the philosophy of business and management, this book systematizes facts and architectural structures based on primary sources.

## 🏛️ Core Tenets (Three Philosophies Underlying the Ontology)

While conventional data infrastructure (data lakes and DWHs) has devolved into "dead data swamps built only for viewing," Palantir's paradigm shift is founded on the following principles.

1. **The Operational Layer (Data as an Operational Layer)**
   Data is not meant for humans to manually move reality after analysis. The ontology is a "digital twin" that replicates real-world business on a system, serving as the layer where data itself directly drives business operations.
2. **Convergence of Noun and Verb (Integration of Nouns and Verbs)**
   Systems are understood as the integration of "Objects (nouns)" and "Actions (verbs)." The model encompasses not only states such as customers and parts (semantics), but also kinetic elements such as orders and status changes (kinetics).
3. **Governance of Reality (Version Control for the Real World)**
   The immense power to rewrite real-world operations demands absolute governance. Even in an era where AI autonomously makes proposals, the ontology achieves both extreme speed and governance through "branching" and "review."
